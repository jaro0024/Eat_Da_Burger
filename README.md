# Eat_Da_Burger

## Description
 A restaurant app that lets users input the name of burgers they would like to eat.

## Technologies used
* MySQL
* Handlebars
* ORM
* Express Server
* Node Server
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Bootstrap

## How it Works
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.
Each burger in the waiting area is a button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
